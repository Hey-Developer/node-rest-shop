Take a Look at your routes file..
Isn't too messy but what we write there
Well we just write a function corresponding to each routes.

So how we make our code clean..
Ans is: Controllers..

? What we have to do : is just make a separate folder named "Controllers" and then inside it..
We copy our functions that run on each routes and make a new function here in controller with a suitable name and then export this function and use it as a middleware in routes request.
